# $SE(3)$ EKF with VINS - One Robot

## Overview

![The setup for the one-robot VINS EKF](/assets/vins/one_robot.png)

This example shows he we can use MILUV to test out an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for a single robot using Visual-Inertial Navigation System (VINS) data. In this example, we will use the following data:

- Gyroscope data from the robot's PX4 IMU, where we ignore the gyro bias for this example. 
- VINS data, which uses the robot's camera and IMU to estimate the robot's velocity.
- UWB range data between the 2 tags on the robot and the 6 anchors in the environment.
- Height data from the robot's downward-facing laser rangefinder.
- Ground truth pose data from a motion capture system to evaluate the EKF.

The state we are trying to estimate is the robot's 3D pose in the absolute frame, which is represented by

$$ \mathbf{T}_{a1} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{C}_{a1} & \mathbf{r}^{1a}_a \\ \mathbf{0} & 1 \end{bmatrix} \in SE(3). $$

We follow the same notation convention as mentioned in the paper, and the reference frame $\{ \mathcal{F}_1 \}$ is the body-fixed reference frame of robot ifo001.

As shown in the figure above, the robot has two UWB tags, $f_1$ and $s_1$, for which we define $\tau_1 \in \\{ f_1, s_1 \\}$. The robot also has 6 anchors in the environment, which are assumed to be stationary and their positions $ \mathbf{r}^{\alpha_i a}_a \in \mathbb{R}^3 $ are known in the absolute frame as provided in `config/uwb/anchors.yaml`. Similarly, the moment arm of the tags on the robot, $ \mathbf{r}^{\tau_1 1}_1 \in \mathbb{R}^3 $, is also known and provided in `config/uwb/tags.yaml`.

## Importing Libraries and MILUV Utilities

We start by importing the necessary libraries and utilities for this example. Firstly, we import the standard libraries `numpy` and `pandas` for numerical computations and data manipulation. 

```py
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

We also import the `liegroups` and `utils` libraries from the `miluv` package, which provide utilities for Lie groups that accompany and other helper functions. 

```py
import utils.liegroups as liegroups
import miluv.utils as utils
```

Each EKF example is accompanied by a *models* module that contains the EKF implementation for that example to hide the implementation details from the main script. This is since the process model, measurement model, jacobians, and evaluation functions specific for the EKF example are irrelevant to showcase how MILUV can be used. Additionally, the *common* module contains utility functions that are shared across all EKF examples. We import these to the main script.

```py
import examples.ekfutils.vins_one_robot_models as model
import examples.ekfutils.common as common
```

## Loading the Data

We start by defining the experiment we want to run the EKF on. In this case, we will use experiment 13.

```py
#################### EXPERIMENT DETAILS ####################
exp_name = "13"
```

We then, in one line, load all the sensor data we want for our EKF. For this example, we only care about ifo001's data.

```py
#################### LOAD SENSOR DATA ####################
miluv = DataLoader(exp_name, imu = "px4", cam = None, mag = False)
data = miluv.data["ifo001"]
```

Additionally, we load the VINS data for ifo001, where we set `loop = False` to avoid loading the loop-closed VINS data, and `postprocessed = True` to load the VINS data that has been aligned with the mocap reference frame.

```py
vins = utils.load_vins(exp_name, "ifo001", loop = False, postprocessed = True)
```

We then extract all timestamps where exteroceptive data is available and within the time range of the VINS data.

```py
query_timestamps = np.append(
    data["uwb_range"]["timestamp"].to_numpy(), data["height"]["timestamp"].to_numpy()
)
query_timestamps = query_timestamps[query_timestamps > vins["timestamp"].iloc[0]]
query_timestamps = query_timestamps[query_timestamps < vins["timestamp"].iloc[-1]]
query_timestamps = np.sort(np.unique(query_timestamps))
```

We then use this to query the gyro and VINS data at these timestamps.

```py
imu_at_query_timestamps = miluv.query_by_timestamps(query_timestamps, robots="ifo001", sensors="imu_px4")["ifo001"]
gyro: pd.DataFrame = imu_at_query_timestamps["imu_px4"][["timestamp", "angular_velocity.x", "angular_velocity.y", "angular_velocity.z"]]
vins_at_query_timestamps = utils.zero_order_hold(query_timestamps, vins)
```

To be able to evaluate our EKF, we extract the ground truth pose data at these timestamps. The `DataLoader` class provides interpolated splines for the ground truth pose data, which we can use to get the ground truth poses at the query timestamps. We use a helper function from the `liegroups` module to convert the mocap pose data to a list of $SE(3)$ poses.

```py
gt_se3 = liegroups.get_se3_poses(
    data["mocap_quat"](query_timestamps), data["mocap_pos"](query_timestamps)
)
```

Lastly, we convert the VINS data from the absolute (mocap) frame to the robot's body frame using the ground truth data, such that we can have interoceptive data in the robot's body frame. This is a bit of a hack to simplify this EKF implementation.

```py
vins_body_frame = common.convert_vins_velocity_to_body_frame(vins_at_query_timestamps, gt_se3)
```

## Extended Kalman Filter

We now implement the EKF for the one-robot VINS example. In here, we will go through some of the implementation details of the EKF, but this is to reiterate that the EKF implementation is in the *models* module and the main script only calls these EKF methods to avoid cluttering the main script. 

We start by initializing a variable to store the EKF state and covariance at each query timestamp for postprocessing.

```py
ekf_history = common.MatrixStateHistory(state_dim=4, covariance_dim=6)
```

We then initialize the EKF with the first ground truth pose, the anchor postions, and UWB tag moment arms. Inside the constructor of the EKF, we add noise to have some initial uncertainty in the state.

```py
ekf = model.EKF(gt_se3[0], miluv.anchors, miluv.tag_moment_arms)
```

The main loop of the EKF is to iterate through the query timestamps and do the prediction and correction steps, which is where the EKF magic happens and is what we will go through next.

```py
for i in range(0, len(query_timestamps)):
    # ----> TODO: Implement the EKF prediction and correction steps
```

### Prediction

The prediction step is done using the gyroscope and VINS data. The continuous-time process model for the orientation is given by

$$ \dot{\mathbf{ C }}_{a1} = \mathbf{C}_{a1} (\mathbf{\omega}^{1a} _ a)^{\wedge}, $$

where $\mathbf{\omega}^{1a} _ a$ is the angular velocity measured by the gyroscope, and $(\cdot)^{\wedge}$ is the skew-symmetric matrix operator in that maps an element of $\mathbb{R}^3$ to the Lie algebra of $SO(3)$. Meanwhile, the continuous-time process model for the position is given by

$$ \dot{\mathbf{r}}^{1a}_a = \mathbf{C}_{a1} \mathbf{v}^{1a}_1, $$

where $\mathbf{v}^{1a}_1$ is the linear velocity measured by VINS after being transformed to the robot's body frame. By defining the input vector as 

$$ \mathbf{u} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{\omega}^{1a}_a \\ \mathbf{v}^{1a}_1 \end{bmatrix}, $$

the continuous-time process model for the state $\mathbf{T}_{a1}$ can be written compactly as

$$ \dot{\mathbf{T}}_{a1} = \mathbf{T}_{a1} \mathbf{u}^{\wedge}, $$

where $(\cdot)^{\wedge}$ here is overloaded to represent the skew-symmetric matrix operator in that maps an element of $\mathbb{R}^6$ to the Lie algebra of $SE(3)$.

In the code, we generate the input vector $\mathbf{u}$ using the gyro and VINS data at the current query timestamp as follows:

```py
for i in range(0, len(query_timestamps)):
    input = np.array([
        gyro.iloc[i]["angular_velocity.x"], gyro.iloc[i]["angular_velocity.y"], 
        gyro.iloc[i]["angular_velocity.z"], vins_body_frame.iloc[i]["twist.linear.x"],
        vins_body_frame.iloc[i]["twist.linear.y"], vins_body_frame.iloc[i]["twist.linear.z"],
    ])

    # ----> TODO: EKF prediction using the gyro and vins data
```

To implement the prediction step in an EKF, we first **discretize** the continuous-time process model over a timestep $\Delta t$ using the matrix exponential to yield

$$ \mathbf{T}_{a1,k+1} = \mathbf{T}_{a1,k} \operatorname{Exp} (\mathbf{u}_k \Delta t), $$

where $\operatorname{Exp} (\cdot)$ is the operator that maps an element of $\mathbb{R}^6$ to $SE(3)$.

In order to use the process model in propagating the covariance of the EKF, we need to **linearize** the system to obtain the Jacobians of the process model with respect to the state and input, respectively. By perturbing the input using $ \mathbf{u} = \bar{\mathbf{u}} + \delta \mathbf{u} $ and the state using 

$$ \mathbf{T}_{a1} = \bar{\mathbf{T}}_{a1} \operatorname{Exp} (\delta \boldsymbol{\xi}) \approx \bar{\mathbf{T}}_{a1} \left( \mathbf{1} + \delta \boldsymbol{\xi}^{\wedge} \right), $$

it can be shown that the linearized process model is given by

$$ \delta \boldsymbol{\xi}_{k+1} = \operatorname{Ad} (\operatorname{Exp} (\bar{\mathbf{u}}_k \Delta t)^{-1}) \delta \boldsymbol{\xi}_k + \Delta t \boldsymbol{\mathcal{J}}_l(-\Delta t \bar{\mathbf{u}_k}) \delta \mathbf{u}_k, $$

where $\operatorname{Ad} (\cdot) : SE(3) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{6 \times 6}$ is the *Adjoint* matrix in $SE(3)$, and $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{J}}_l(\cdot)$ is the left Jacobian of $SE(3)$.

The process model and the Jacobians are implemented in the *models* module, and as such the prediction step boils down to simply calling the `predict` method of the EKF.

```py
for i in range(0, len(query_timestamps)):
    # .....
    
    # Do an EKF prediction using the gyro and vins data
    dt = (query_timestamps[i] - query_timestamps[i - 1]) if i > 0 else 0
    ekf.predict(input, dt)
```

### Correction

The correction takes a similar approach. We do correction using both the UWB range data between the anchors and the tags on the robot, and the height data from the robot's downward-facing laser rangefinder. Starting with the UWB range data, the measurement model is given by

$$ y = \lVert \mathbf{r}_a^{\alpha_i \tau_j} \rVert, $$

which can be written as

$$ y = \lVert \mathbf{r}_a^{\alpha_i a} - (\mathbf{C}_{a1} \mathbf{r}_1^{\tau_j 1} + \mathbf{r}_a^{1a}) \rVert. $$

It can be shown that this can be written as a function of the state using

$$ y = \lVert \mathbf{r}_a^{\alpha_i a} - \boldsymbol{\Pi} \mathbf{T}_{a1} \mathbf{\tilde{r}}_{1}^{\tau_j 1} \rVert $$

where 

$$ \boldsymbol{\Pi} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{1}_3 & \mathbf{0}_{3 \times 1} \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 4}, \qquad \mathbf{\tilde{r}}_{1}^{\tau_j 1} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{r}_1^{\tau_j 1} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^4. $$

Deriving the Jacobian is a bit involved, but it can be shown that by defining a vector

$ \boldsymbol{\nu} = \mathbf{r}_a^{\alpha_i a} - \boldsymbol{\Pi} \bar{\mathbf{T}} _ {a1} \mathbf{\tilde{r}} _ {1} ^ {\tau_j 1}, $

the Jacobian of the measurement model with respect to the state is given by

$$ \delta y = - \frac{\boldsymbol{\nu}^\intercal}{\lVert \boldsymbol{\nu} \rVert} \boldsymbol{\Pi} \bar{\mathbf{T}}_{a1} (\mathbf{\tilde{r}}_{1}^{\tau_j 1})^\odot \delta \boldsymbol{\xi}, $$

where $(\cdot)^\odot : \mathbb{R}^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{4 \times 6}$ is the *odot* operator in $SE(3)$.

Similar to the prediction step, the correction step boils down to simply calling the `correct` method of the EKF as the measurement model and the Jacobians are implemented in the *models* module. We first check if range data is available at the current query timestamp, and if so, we do a correction using the range data.

```py
# Iterate through the query timestamps
for i in range(0, len(query_timestamps)):
    # .....

    # Check if range data is available at this query timestamp, and do an EKF correction
    range_idx = np.where(data["uwb_range"]["timestamp"] == query_timestamps[i])[0]
    if len(range_idx) > 0:
        range_data = data["uwb_range"].iloc[range_idx]
        ekf.correct({
            "range": float(range_data["range"].iloc[0]),
            "to_id": int(range_data["to_id"].iloc[0]),
            "from_id": int(range_data["from_id"].iloc[0])
        })
```

Meanwhile, the height data is given by

$$ y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \mathbf{r}_a^{1a}. $$

This can be written as a function of the state using

$$ y = \mathbf{a}^\intercal \mathbf{T}_{a1} \mathbf{b}, $$

where 

$$ \mathbf{a} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \qquad \mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}. $$

The Jacobian of the measurement model with respect to the state can be derived to be

$$ \delta y = \mathbf{a}^\intercal \bar{\mathbf{T}}_{a1} \mathbf{b}^\odot \delta \boldsymbol{\xi}. $$

We then check if height data is available at the current query timestamp, and if so, we do a correction using the height data.

```py
for i in range(0, len(query_timestamps)):
    # .....

    # Check if height data is available at this query timestamp, and do an EKF correction
    height_idx = np.where(data["height"]["timestamp"] == query_timestamps[i])[0]
    if len(height_idx) > 0:
        height_data = data["height"].iloc[height_idx]
        ekf.correct({"height": float(height_data["range"].iloc[0])})
```

Lastly, we store the EKF state and covariance at this query timestamp for postprocessing.

```py
for i in range(0, len(query_timestamps)):
    # .....

    # Store the EKF state and covariance at this query timestamp
    ekf_history.add(query_timestamps[i], ekf.x, ekf.P)
```

## Results

We can now evaluate the EKF using the ground truth data and plot the results. We first evaluate the EKF using the ground truth data and the EKF history, using the example-specific evaluation functions in the *models* module. 

```py
analysis = model.EvaluateEKF(gt_se3, ekf_history, exp_name)
```

Lastly, we call the following functions to plot the results and save the results to disk, and we are done!

```py
analysis.plot_error()
analysis.plot_poses()
analysis.save_results()
```
